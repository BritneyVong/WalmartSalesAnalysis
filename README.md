# Walmart Sales Analysis
In this project, I used MySQL to analyze Walmart sales data to gain insight and understand the different factors that affect sales of the different branches.

## About The Data
I found this dataset from Kaggle. It contains sales transactions from three different branches of Walmart, respectively located in Mandalay, Yangon and Naypyitaw.

## Notes
For more detailed information about the data, I modified the table to add some new columns:

> time_of_day will give insight into sales in the Morning, Afternoon, and Evening. This will help answer the question of which part of the day most sales are made.
